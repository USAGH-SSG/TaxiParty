# TaxiParty
Website that provides Taxi-sharing service to those serving their nation at CFC/USAG Humphreys

# Motivation
One has to take a taxi to enter/exit Camp Humphreys and travel to nearby hubs like Pyeongtaek St.
While one can group with others to reduce the taxi cost by splitting the bill, this isn't necesserilly easy due to the lack of information.
Through the website, one can post and join "Taxi Parties" prescheduled for a specific time, origin, and destination
